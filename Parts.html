		<h3 class = "cent">Mother Board</h3>
		<p>	The mother board of the computer houses many components
		of the PC, including the CPU, RAM, connectors, IO, chips for various
		purposes, the graphics processor and more.</p>

		One of the components on the mother board is the CPU, or Central
		Processing Unit, which does simple calculations for programs that
		the computer wants to run. It can only do fairly simple 
		calculations, but it does so many of them in one second that it
		heats up really quickly, which is why it needs it's very own
		cooling system. In the Image of the mother board above, we 
		removed the cooling system in order to take off the mother 
		board.

		Another notable component that resides on the mother board is
		Input/Output Panel. This small panel consists of many ports
		and connectors to communicate to other computers or machines
		like printers (even though some new printers can connect via
		wifi). The I/O system is vital to the computer, since without 
		it the computer would not be able to display information or get
		input, let alone typing up and printing a document. Basically how the PC communicates.

		One other important and noticable component on the mother board
		 are the memory slots, or the slots that store sticks of RAM. 
		 This is another very important part of the PC because it's 
		 short-term memory for the computer to focus on one task or 
		 program at the moment. It allows the computer to complete tasks, and basically
		lets the computer store memory for programs.

		Another important part of the computer is the Power Supply Unit. 
		As the name suggests, this unit supplies power to...well, the PC.
		Without it you probably wouldn't be able to run the computer, or
		watch your favourite anime, etc., etc.

		<hr>
		A Hard Drive/Solid State Drive is another very important part
		of the PC. It stores Programs and information, basically 
		everything the computer knows. But we don't have either of 
		those in our computer. What we do have, though, is a floppy 
		disk drive, which is basically the same thing (it also stores information such as games and text files).
