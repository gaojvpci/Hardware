		<hr>
		<p> To take the Computer apart, we first had to take off the cover. </p>

		<hr>
		<p> Next, we proceeded to take the mother board off, by unscrewing some screws and pulling hard.</p>

		<p> After that, we took out the Floppy disk drive, unscrewed the hinge screws (making it two separate parts)
		and unscrewed a small I/O panel.</p>

		<p> Now everything has been taken off the panel on the floppy disk side! Hooray!</p>

		<hr>
		<p> Next, we took of the power supply. This was REALLY tricky because first we had to take the fan off, and then
		we had to bend the cover to get at the screws INSIDE the box because we could not get to a screw that was locking the cover on, 
		which is why the cover is bent. But we did get it back on in the end, although it was quite tricky and Torrie started to bleed at some point.

		<p> Now we're done! "ALL" we have to do now is put it back together.</p>
