            <hr>                                         
			Our Page is about our Hardware Project assigned to us in our Introduction to Computer Science class, and what we're doing is taking
			apart a computer and reassembling it, to learn about its parts, where they go, and how they function.
			<hr>                                                       
			Our first <a href = "taking.html">Page</a> consists of pictures of us taking the computer apart, and examining the components and
			what they might be, and what role they play in the Computer.
			<hr>                                                  
			Our second <a href = "taking.html">page</a> is about putting the PC together, and the right parts in the right places after 
			we've learned what each component does.
			<hr>                                                        
			Our third <a href = "info.html">page</a> is about our project, and what our goal. Just an overview of the project.
			<hr>                                            
			Our last <a href = "Parts.html">page</a> is about the parts of the PC, and what part each of them plays in the whole PC.
