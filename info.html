			<h2>Information on the Project</h2>
			<hr>
			This project was assigned to us in our ICS class in Victoria Park Collegiate Institute. The assignment is to take apart an old PC
			and examine it's inner workings, and find out what each part does to make the computer run properly.
			<hr>
			First off, we took apart the computer. There are <a href = "taking.html">photos of us taking it apart on another page.</a>
			It was pretty straightforward, just taking screws out and pulling things out. While we were taking it apart, we tried to 
			figure out what all the <a href = "Parts.html">parts</a> were. Next, <a href = "putting.html">we put it back together,</a> and had a bit of trouble since
			we couldn't put the power supply back together. It was tricky because when we took it apart I had to bend the cover of the power supply
			in order to actually take it out, because screws on the inside of it connected it to the board, and I had to bend the cover because 
			was on screw we couldn't take off.
